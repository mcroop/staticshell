Although the shell does build using ghc --make Main.hs, properly
managing threads only works properly using runghc.
"runghc Main.hs" should work.


Included Files:

Command.hs
==========
Here we define the types we use to deal with Commands.  ArgType is
meant to represent the syntax of possible command completions, and
Command is intended to represent full commands, ready for execution

CmdParser.hs
============
Here we define a tokenizer for basic shell input and a function
to transform parsed tokens into Commands

Completion.hs
=============

Derivative.hs
=============

Schema.hs
=========

Main.hs
=======
Here we define the main loop, which is just a shell prompt
